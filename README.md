# AutoTranslationPlugin

This project is a ROUNDS BepInEx plugin aiming at translating the game's labels to any supported language.

## Installation

The plugin requires [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) to be installed on ROUNDS and is dependent to [UnboundLib-3.1.2](https://github.com/Rounds-Modding/UnboundLib) and [XUnity.AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator) plugins. You can also easily setup and mod the game with the [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) from Overwolf

## Credits
