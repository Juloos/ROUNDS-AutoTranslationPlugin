# AutoTranslationPlugin

WORK IN PROGRESS


## Settings

You can change the language option in `MODS > AUTOTRANSLATIONPLUGIN`. 

Select there your language, and then hit the red button to load it, this action will shut down the game, you will have to restart it in order to play the translated game.

There are currently latin-based languages only, this is because of the game's font which does not support other alphabets. Non-latin based languages will be added later.


## Custom dictionaries

The plugin comes with a custom translation dictionary for french, but you are welcome to contact me at juloos.sfr@gmail.com, or simply DM to `Juloos#4653` on Discord, if (and only if !) you want to help get a deeper localization of the game in your language.


## Technical details

The plugin sends requests to the Google Translate API to translate the text, and text is translated on the go. So you will need internet connection in order for the plugin to work.


## Credits
